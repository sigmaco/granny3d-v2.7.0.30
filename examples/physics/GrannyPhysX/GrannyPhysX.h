//
// Summary
// -------
//  This is intended to be a razor-thin layer that interfaces a
//  collection of PhysX actors to a granny_model_instance.  The
//  intention is to provide a tool sufficient to integrate simple
//  ragdoll animation and physical feedback into your animation
//  system, and to provide enough access that more advanced effects
//  (Animation driven forces applied to models for collision feedback,
//  etc) can be either added as extensions to this interface, or
//  supported as a higher-level layer in your application.
//
//  To keep the mapping between Ageia and Granny relatively simple, we
//  make a few assumptions about the granny_model_instance and the
//  NxuPhysicsCollection.  Primarily, we're assuming that
//   - Every actor in the collection is significant (they're all added
//     to the scene unconditionally.)
//   - granny_bones are related to NxActors by name correspondence.  
//   - Not more than one actor is present for any given bone.
//   - The NxActors are in the same space as the granny_model_instance.
//     I.e, if you have changed the coordinate system of the source
//     model by GrannyTransformFile or another similar API call, you
//     have to ensure that the NxActors are in the same space.
//   - The GrannyPhysX assumes that it owns all pointers to objects
//     instantiated from the PhysicsCollection.  It assumes that the
//     SDK, Scene, and model_instance objects will be valid as long as
//     the mapping exists, but it doesn't assume ownership of those
//     objects, so you must clean them up yourself.  There's no need
//     to cleanup the actor and constraint objects, they're deleted in
//     grp_releaseMapping.
//   - The error detection model is to assert in debug, and treat
//     release builds as "rails-off".  Calling getActor with a
//     nonsense index will assert in debug, and most likely simply
//     crash in release.  You can replace the assert macro with
//     something more appropriate in this file if you'd like to handle
//     release-mode errors in a different way.
//
//  For some games these assumptions may be just fine.  If not, we've
//  tried to keep the API small enough that you can modify it to
//  support whatever constraints are necessary for your application
//  without too much effort.  Please write us if you feel that there
//  are pieces missing from the API, and especially write us if you
//  find better ways to do the same things!
//
// Todo
// ----
//  - How do we attach mulitple NxActors to a bone?  Might want this
//    for complicated ragdolls.  Is it worth trying to fit that into
//    this layer?
//  - Should we provide an interface that takes a list of NxActors,
//    rather than an NxuPhysicsCollection as well?
