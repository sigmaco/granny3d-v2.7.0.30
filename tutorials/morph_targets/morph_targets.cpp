/* DEFTUTORIAL EXPGROUP(TutorialMorphTargets) (TutorialMorphTargets_Introduction, Introduction) */
/* Starting with the 2.7.0.15 release of Granny, we've added more detailed support for
   mesh morphing animations.  The Morpher modifier of Max, and the BlendShape modifier in
   Maya will now export animations separate from the skeletal track that you can easily
   sample to reproduce the effects in your game.  In addition, you're no longer restricted
   to doing frame-by-frame sampling of your morphs, the exporter can now read the links
   stored in the morph modifiers to extract the meshes directly.  There's more information
   on the exporter interface to this functionality in $MorphTargets.

   In this tutorial, we'll be taking an example file with a very simple morph animation
   specified in Max with the Morpher modifier, and showing you how to sample the run it
   through a vertex shader.  You can find the source art for the model and animation we're
   using in (morph_targets/media/morpher test.max).

   Like most of the other tutorials that render bits, this is based on a version of the
   DX9 tutorial.  As always, if you need information on how to runder in Direct X with
   Granny, you're better off examining the code in that tutorial instead of here.  You
   should be noticing that in the more advanced tutorials, we're explaining those bits
   less and less.
   $-

   In particular, we're shaving off huge sections of code from the extracted tutorial that
   are unchanged from the actual rendering tutorial.  In the case of this morph tutorial,
   the only interesting bits of code are the RenderModel function, where we set up the
   shader parameters, and the mesh initialization, where we find and setup vertex buffers
   for our morph targets.

   Prerequisites to this demo:
   $* $TutorialBasicLoading
   $* $TutorialDX9Rendering

   New functions and structures discussed in this tutorial:
   $* $vector_track
   $* $EvaluateCurveAtT

/* When you create the hardware resources (index and vertex buffers) for morph targets,
   obviously you have a little extra work to do.  In our case, we're going to take the
   morph vertices, and download only the positional deltas.  I'm doing this in an
   extremely unfancy way, you could theoretically profitably combine everything into one
   vertex buffer, or play other sorts of memory tricks, but as always, we're going for
   simplicity here.

    /* When the Granny exporter encounters a Morpher modifier, it creates a separate
       $animation entry in the $file_info::Animations array with a name equal to that of
       the mesh that contains the morph targets.

       This is the first time in the tutorial series that we've run into the need to use
       the $vector_track entries in a $track_group, so it's worth talking about them
       briefly.  In this case, the $vector_track object is encoding the animated morph
       values from the modifier.  A $vector_track can encode a curve of (nearly) arbitrary
       dimension, though here, it's obviously a 1-dimensional value.  It's essentially the
       same as a $transform_track, but without the implied transformation grouping.  Both
       $(vector_track)s and $(transform_track)s share the same underlying $curve2
       representation, and are sampled using the same high-speed core.

       The only major difference is that while Granny contains a lot of machinery to
       handle sampling $(transform_track)s en masse ($SampleModelAnimations for instance),
       $(vector_track)s are considered something that you'll want to be intimately
       involved with.  You'll need to acquaint yourself with the low-level $curve2
       sampling functions $EvaluateCurveAtT and the like.

       So let's go grab the $vector_track objects that have encoded the time series of
       morph percentages that we specified in Max.  For a Morpher animation, there will be
       just one $track_group with the name "MorphCurves", which will contain only
       $vector_track objects that have names that align with the names of the
       $morph_target meshes.  It's important to match these up, because while the morph
       targets are simply placed in the mesh in the order that they're encountered,
       $track_group elements are sorted by name.  So unless you name everything Mesh01,
       Mesh02, etc., there will be disagreement over ordering.  In this case, since we
       know that the memory is never going away, we'll just pull out the pointer to the
       appropriate $vector_track.
