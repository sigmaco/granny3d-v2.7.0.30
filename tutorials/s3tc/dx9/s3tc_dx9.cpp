/* This tutorial demonstrates how to download an S3TC (also called: DXTC) compressed
   texture directly to a DirectX9 Texture object.  This prevents both runtime costs, and
   quality problems associated with putting the texture through a decompress recompress
   cycle.  The bits found in the miplevels of an S3TC compressed $texture can be directly
   sent to the card.  In order to determine the correct format (DXT[1-5]), you simply need
   to intepret the value of SubFormat found in the $texture as a $s3tc_texture_format, and
   map that to the appropriate DirectX enumerant.

       or $file_info, so simply free that memory now.  As always, freeing the $file
       removes the memory backing the $file_info, so we can simply NULL out that pointer.
       (See $TutorialBasicLoading for details.)

       Before we do that, we'll demonstrate one important feature of the Granny file API,
       which is that you can selectively throw away portions of the $file that you no
       longer need.  In this case, once we've downloaded the pixels to the hardware,
       there's no point in keeping the bits around in main memory as well, so we'll free
       the $StandardTextureSection.  This will remove the pixels from memory, while
       leaving the rest of the file untouched.  There are a few things to remember about
       this process:
       $* Only the pixel bytes are freed.  You are still able to access the $texture
          members like Width and Height after freeing the texture section.
       $* This only works if you've maintained the default Granny file structure in your
          toolchain.  If you write tools that change the section layout from the default
          created by the exporter, this may cause unexpected problems.  If you want to
          restore the default section layout, you can always use the Preprocessor command
          "ResectionFile"
       $* If you have "surface lost" conditions in your game, you may have to reload the
          file to recover the missing pieces.
       $-

       After a $FreeFileSection call, you can still bin the rest of the memory with
       $FreeFile, as always.
