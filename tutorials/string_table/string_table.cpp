/* DEFTUTORIAL EXPGROUP(TutorialStringTable) (TutorialStringTable_Introduction, Introduction) */
/* One of the nicest features of Granny is that most element matching and versioning is
   done by string matching.  This allows you to ignore problems like mismatched array
   indices across multiple files, data type ordering issues when upgrading file versions,
   and similar problems.  One of the downsides of this flexibility is that there is a lot
   of duplicated string data in any given Granny file.
   $-

   For instance, a $skeleton contains an array of $bone objects, each of which has a
   "Name" field.  This is used to match against the "Name" field in the $transform_track
   objects contained in $animation objects, which allows these arrays to be in different
   orders without causing problems.  However, if you start figuring out how much space is
   taken up by these names ...(20 bytes/bone, 100 bones/character ~= 2000 bytes per
   character per file)...  It adds up.
   $-

   Luckily, you can do something about this problem.  Granny allows you to specify a
   callback function on file writes and file reads that is used to replace the string
   literals stored by default with table indices that lookup the strings in a shared
   database of strings.  That way, each of your bone names is represented once and only
   once, each $data_type_definition field name is represented only once, and so forth.
   $-

   With the release of Granny 2.7.0.17, we've made using the string replacement API much
   easier, and integrated the feature with the preprocessor.  You can use the preprocessor
   commands "ExtractStrings" and "RemapStrings" to build a $string_database object, and
   remap the string literals in your files to indices in the shared database.  At runtime,
   you simply load the file containing the $string_database, and after loading a
   $file_info, simply replace the string indices with the correct pointers, and you're
   set!
   $-

   <b>Note:</b> while we've made this as easy as possible in newer versions of the
   library, this is still considered an "advanced" topic in Granny, and something you
   should only undertake if you're prepared to get into the inner workings of the Granny
   file and type systems.  Still with us?  Ok, let's dive in.
   $-

   So there's a little bit of prep work that we do with the preprocessor to make this
   work.  We're going to extract the strings from two of our example files to create the
   string database, then remap the strings to the appropriate indices in that table.
   Since that happens at the command-line, rather than in the program, I've provided the
   batch file to run the correct commands, you can find it in the media directory of the
   string_table tutorial as "prep_files.bat".  The output of this script consists of three
   files, "database.gsd", "gryphon_remap.gr2", and "pixo_run_remap.gr2".  In general, you
   should name your $(string_database)s files with the extension "GSD" to distinguish them
   from files encoding $file_info structures.  The results are already present in the
   distribution, but you can rerun the script at anytime to get the idea.

    /* Now we obtain the $file_info objects for our Pixo runcycle, and the Gryphon.
       There's a subtlety here that you have to handle correctly.  If the version of
       Granny matches the version of the file, you could simply call $GetFileInfo, and use
       the $RebasePointersStringCallback to patch the file up afterwards.  This still
       works, but we strongly recommend you use the new API for patching strings at the
       $file level.  The reason for this is to correctly support versioning.
       $-

       The Granny file versioning essentially works by comparing the metadata stored in
       the file as $data_type_definition entries, with the current version of the type
       that you're converting to, in this case $file_info.  The problem is that member
       matching, in the case of updated or changed structures is done by field name.  With
       remapped strings, the name fields in the $(data_type_definition)s of the old file
       are indices, which cannot be directly compared to the strings in the in-memory copy
       of the $file_info type information.  You could envision a hack where we register a
       string callback, and look at the pointer values in the comparison to see if they
       fall within the reasonable index range, but that's hardly industrial strength.  So
       we've provided an API, $RemapFileStrings, which accepts a $file object and replaces
       the string entries in its encoded type tree with the entries from a
       $string_database.  This ensures that if a version upgrade is required in
       $GetFileInfo, the type information has proper strings to match against.
