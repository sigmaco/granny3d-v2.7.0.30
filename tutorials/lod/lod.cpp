/* DEFTUTORIAL EXPGROUP(TutorialLOD) (TutorialLOD_Introduction, Introduction) */
/* Animation LOD is a powerful tool for reducing the CPU load of your animation.
   Especially when you're rendering hundreds or even thousands of characters, every cycle
   counts, but even when you're rendering a few, why spend cycles on something that the
   user can't see?  We discuss the basic mechanisms available to you in $AnimationLod, so
   our goal here is simply to show you how to modify your application to take advantage of
   the feature.  As you'll see below, as few as 5-10 lines of code need to change from the
   sampling paths you already have in place.
   $-

   As always, we're building this example on the bones of our old friend
   $TutorialDX9Rendering, and eliding any code discussed in that tutorial.  If you haven't
   already worked through that example, it's recommended that you examine that code first.
   Once you're comfortable with the way bone matrices flow around between Granny and the
   rendering interface, it'll be easier to understand the changes below.
   $-

   Part of the tutorial is prepping the $animation LOD parameters.  Skeletal LOD is
   computed automatically for you by the exporter, but for determining the error values
   for individual $track_group elements, you need various bits of information that aren't
   necessarily available at export time.  Luckily, the Granny Preprocessor can take care
   of this for you fairly trivially.  In the "media" directory of this sample, there is a
   script: prep_scene.bat that takes the pixo_run.gr2 file from the common media
   directory, and adds the LOD parameters, as well as cleaning the mesh for display.
   There is some commentary on different ways to run the LOD calculation step, so make
   sure to check out that file in your tutorial directory.
   $-

   When you run the demo, you'll see 3 synchronized copys of the Pixomatic model, in his
   standard run cycle.  The center copy is rendered at essentially full detail.  The
   version on the right shows Pixo at a distance, with LODed animations.  The version on
   the left is Pixo rendered at the same size as the full detail version, but with the
   same LOD parameter as the distant copy, to show up close what the LOD system is doing.
   Use the "Page Up" and "Page Down" keys to move the distant model farther away from or
   toward the screen.
   $-

   Prerequisites to this demo:
   $* $TutorialDX9Rendering

/* DEFTUTORIAL EXPGROUP(TutorialLOD) (TutorialLOD_RenderModel, RenderModel) */
/* The actual rendering calls in this function are no different than those of
   $TutorialDX9Rendering_RenderModel, so I've elided the commentary for those sections.
   The only difference here is that before sampling the $model_instance's animation, we're
   going to compute a LOD factor, and use that to control how many bones we actually work
   with.
   $-

   To compute the LOD parameter, the easiest thing to do is to use the supplied API,
   $FindAllowedLODError.  Because we don't want to assume that you're using a $camera,
   this takes the 3 salient parameters (Viewport height, vertical field of view, and
   distance from the camera) as arguments.  The first parameter is the error in screen
   space that you're willing to accept.  You can get essentially perfect reproduction with
   0.5 pixels of error, but you should dial this parameter until the results are
   acceptable.  The higher the error that you can get away with, the less work Granny will
   do in the sampling path.  We've chosen an estimated screen space error of 1 pixel for
   this demo.  Note that nothing requires you to use a constant error across the entire
   application.  One technique that you can use to squeeze out even more performance is to
   tie the screen error to the computed distance to the object.  So you might allow 0.5
   pixels of error until the model is 25 meters away, and then ramp up the allowed error
   to 2 pixels over the next 100 meters.
   $-

   In this example, we compute the LOD parameter for each model, but if you're concerned
   about the overhead, you can simply compute the LOD parameter for a distance of 1.0
   units, and then scale that factor by the actual distance to your object.  Since the
   projected size of world space distance in screen space scales linearly (more or less)
   with respect to distance from the camera, you can simply store off that Unit Error for
   the camera at the start of the frame, and reuse it until the view changes.
   $-

   The most efficient way to sample a $model_instance's animations is still
   $SampleModelAnimationsAccelerated.  This function has a "LOD enabled" version,
   $SampleModelAnimationsAcceleratedLOD, that simply takes the LOD parameter and does the
   computation for you.  That's it.  You now have a LOD enabled game.
   $-

   If you're not using the $SampleModelAnimationsAccelerated path, you have to do a tiny
   bit more work.  The version of the LOD sampling path that uses
   $SampleModelAnimationsLOD and $BuildWorldPoseLOD is laid out below as well in comment
   form.  It's important to note that while $SampleModelAnimationsLOD takes the truncated
   number of bones to sample, $BuildWorldPoseLOD needs to build a valid world pose for all
   of the $skeleton's bones, so you must pass the normal bone count.  (Unless you know
   from your mesh LOD system that those bones won't be used, but that's a topic for a
   different tutorial...)  $-

   One final note.  Because we want to draw the model several times in this demo, to
   demonstrate what the LODed animation looks like, I've separated the offset that we
   "pretend" the model is at (ComputeOffset) from the offset that we actually render the
   model at (RenderOffset).  To keep it simple, I've also passed the BufferHeight into
   this function, which should, of course, normally not be necessary in your own
   RenderModel style functions, but it lets us keep all of the LOD calls in one function
   for the purposes of the tutorial.
