/* DEFTUTORIAL EXPGROUP(TutorialAttachment) (TutorialAttachment_Introduction, Introduction) */
/* This tutorial will demonstrate a working (if simple) attachment system for sticking a
   model onto a specific bone on another model.  The Granny document
   $AnimationInDepth_AttachmentSection goes into some detail about how to make this
   process more efficient on a larger scale by caching static results, etc.  What we're
   trying to accomplish here is just to show you how to use the $GetAttachmentOffset API,
   and to cascade the attachment offset into the $world_pose of the attached model.

   To that end, we'll bring back our favorite demo character, Pixo, and put a baton in his
   left hand, and attach a tiny cape to his neck.  Advance apologies for the programmer
   art contained in this demo.  :)

   Prerequisites to this demo:
   $* $TutorialBasicLoading
   $* $TutorialCreateControl
   $* $TutorialDX9Rendering

   New functions and structures discussed in this tutorial:
