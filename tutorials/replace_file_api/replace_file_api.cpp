/* DEFTUTORIAL EXPGROUP(TutorialReplaceFileAPI) (TutorialReplaceFileAPI_Introduction, Introduction) */
/* This tutorial shows you how to override Granny's file manipulation functions, replacing
   them with custom versions that you provide.  You might do this in order to provide
   optimized versions that are specialized for your application.  If you want to redirect
   the file opening requests to an internal database or virtual filesystem independent of
   the OS file system, you can do that as well, which is what we'll demonstrate here.

   The support functions in replace_file_api_helper.cpp load 2 Granny files into a simple
   flat array.  (These functions aren't contained in the tutorial since they're incidental
   to what we're demonstrating here.)  We then provide reader functions to redirect read
   requests from $ReadEntireFile to the flat array.

   There are two ways to go about using the replacement functions.  First, you can replace
   Granny's default file handling with $SetDefaultFileReaderOpenCallback.  This causes
   every call to $ReadEntireFile to route to your functions.  (You can still access
   Granny's default file handlers with $CreatePlatformFileReader.)  Second, if you don't
   want to entirely replace the file system, you can create a custom $file_reader, and
   pass it to $ReadEntireFileFromReader.  We'll demonstrate both methods here.

   Note that you can override the writer functionality in exactly the same way, but we
   won't cover that here.

/* You should now be able to route Granny's file requests wherever you want.  Remember

   input filename is entirely up to you!  You might want to interpret strings like
   "network:foo.gr2" as a request to open foo.gr2 from your website, while "disk:bar.gr2"
   would route to the local filesystem.  Because the function pointers are stored in the
   reader itself, rather than in the global Granny settings, you can return multiple
   different types of $file_reader objects from your open callback, and Granny will handle
   them transparently.

   From here, you might want to investigate:

   $* $TutorialReplaceMemoryAPI: replace Granny's allocation system in the
   same way.
   $* $TutorialCustomFormat or $TutorialTreeWalker: create custom formats and walk the
   granny metadata structures.
   $* $TutorialTransformFile: convert Granny files into your application's
   coordinate system.
   $* $TutorialMultithreading: hide loading latency by doing loads and other work with
   worker threads.
