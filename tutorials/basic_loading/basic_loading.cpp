/* DEFTUTORIAL EXPGROUP(TutorialBasicLoading) (TutorialBasicLoading_Introduction, Introduction) */
/* This tutorial shows you how to load a Granny file, and dump some basic information
   about it.  Granny provides a completely structure-driven interface to its files, so
   there are no accessor calls to remember, no strange RIFF-style parsing that occurs; you
   just get back a pointer to the in-memory version of the file, and all the data is
   accessible by walking the structures directly.  Pointer fixup, endian-swapping, and
   version upgrading are all handled internally, so once you've obtained the $file and
   $file_info structures, you can access the data directly on any platform.

   To keep the example small, since this is probably the first thing you're looking at,
   we're not going to exhaustively walk the data tree.  In later examples (such as:
   $TutorialTreeWalker), we'll show you how to use Granny's object metadata to process
   every last bit of data in the file.  You should note that while we're loading a
   standard Granny file here, nothing prevents you from creating your own file format, and
   using the same Granny API calls to load, process, and platform convert your own custom
   structures.  We'll show you how to do that in $TutorialCustomFormat.
