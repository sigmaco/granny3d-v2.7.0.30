/* DEFTUTORIAL EXPGROUP(TutorialExtendedData) (TutorialExtendedData_Introduction, Introduction) */
/* Granny can't know everything about the models that you work with in Maya and Max.  Even
   if we could, imagine what the Granny structures would look like if we tried to take
   every possible object field into account!  Ouch.  However, we do try to export every
   last piece of data from the tools that we can find.  In most cases, these custom
   attributes wind up in the ExtendedData fields attached to the base Granny structures.
   For instance $bone contains an ExtendedData field that we use to store information
   about Camera or Light parameters, if the bone represents one of these objects, a
   $(material)'s ExtendedData field might contain shader parameters, and so forth.

   This tutorial will show you how to extract that data so you can work with it in your
   toolchain or your engine.  The example we'll use is the extraction of Camera and Light
   parameters from a Granny file originally exported from Maya.  (You'll see some of this
   put to use in $TutorialDX9Rendering.)  The source art for the demo can be found in the
   "media" directory of this tutorial, if you want to see the file setup.

   Before we begin, you might want to refer to the documentation on $(variant)s.  As long
   as you understand that a $variant is nothing more than an chunk of object data along
   with a $data_type_definition array that describes the data, the tutorial will make
   sense.  Granny uses $(variant)s whenever we can't (or don't want to) build a fixed
   structure to hold extracted information.  In the case of LightInfo, for example, we
   could in theory build a granny_light structure that held common fields shared across
   all content packages, but we prefer to simply extract as much information as we can
   from the content package and leave the interpretation up to you.  This prevents us from
   inadvertently restricting your freedom by either imposing our own interpretation on a
   field, or leaving it out entirely because it's not common to all of the content
   packages.  At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to write small routines to
   extract whatever you want from the ExtendedData fields in just a few minutes, which is
   a pretty fair tradeoff for having the full expressive power of your DCC tool available
   to you.

/* The simplest way to extract data from a $variant is to define a structure that
   describes the fields that are interesting to you, and use $ConvertSingleObject to have
   Granny do the translation for you.  There are other methods, such as using the

   you need to get your fingers all the way into the type information, but this is
   sufficient for our purposes.
